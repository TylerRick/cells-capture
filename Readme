= Cells Capture helpers

== Intro

This adds some helpers to Cells <http://github.com/apotonick/cells>.

Example:

app/cells/capture_test/display.html.erb

  <% outer_content_for :greetings do %>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <% end %>

If you then render this cell from a view (doesn't work from a controller because it requires the view context), say like this:

app/views/home/index.html.erb

  <%= render_cell :capture_test, :display %>

This executes #content_for in the context of the outer ActionView view context. The captured markup can then be accessed in your outer action view or in your layout, like this:

app/views/layouts/application.html.erb:

  <%= content_for :greetings %>

== Known issues

It appears that the markup within the outer_content_for block in your cell view appends that markup to your cell view instead of simply capturing it. This is a serious problem and I'm not sure why it is happening.
